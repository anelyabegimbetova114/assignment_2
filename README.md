Install Dependencies:
Begin by installing the required packages. In this assignment, we use the Web3 package. Make sure your package.json file includes the necessary dependencies.

Configure INFURA and Sepolia TestNet:
Utilize INFURA as your Ethereum node provider, specifically connecting to the Sepolia TestNet. Ensure your MetaMask is set up and connected to this TestNet.

Deployment of Smart Contract (Assignment 1):
Deploy your smart contract from Assignment 1 by compiling it to obtain the ABI and bytecode. This information is crucial for interacting with the contract.

Transaction Signing and Sending:
Sign the transaction using a private key, and send it to the Ethereum network. This involves interacting with the deployed smart contract on Sepolia TestNet.

Function Invocation from the Contract:
Call functions from the deployed smart contract. This step is essential for testing and verifying the functionality of the smart contract deployed on the Sepolia TestNet.
